# password_menager
This project is a work of mine to make all my passwords stash in one place this will encode all my passwords in some json files and encryping it.
If i want to see all of my real passwords I need to enter my admin password.
This project isn't finished wet because I wont to make a database to make it more secure bcs in this state you can open the json file that have the passwords and read them even if you dont know the admin password
